# Project1-AWS-S3
Hosting a static website on Amazon S3

In this project, I:
✅ Created and configured an Amazon S3 bucket, complete with ACLs, versioning, and public access.
✅ Uploaded website content, diving deep into how static websites function and how to host them on S3.
✅ Tackled public access settings and fixed an interesting challenge with the website's visibility.

I took the help of the NextWork community which I'm part of as a student.
